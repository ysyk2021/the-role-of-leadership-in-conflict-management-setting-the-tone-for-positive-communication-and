Once bias and discrimination have been identified, leaders must take steps to address them. This may involve:

* Providing training to employees on diversity, inclusion, and equity.
* Reviewing and revising organizational policies and procedures to prevent bias and discrimination.
* Creating affinity groups or employee resource groups to support underrepresented groups.
